# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Before fanning out, find this conversation's transcript. On Antigravity, use `<appDataDir>/brain/<conversation-id>/.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl` from the system prompt. On Cursor, find this conversation's transcript in the `agent-transcripts/` directory the system prompt names. Do not glob across `~/.cursor/projects/*/` or unrelated brain directories. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

```bash
ls -t <agent-transcripts>/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

That covers the legacy flat (`<id>.jsonl`), current nested (`<id>/<id>.jsonl`), and subagent (`<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`) layouts. For each candidate, read the first JSONL line. Take the file whose `message.content[0].text` (Cursor) or `content` on the opening `USER_INPUT` step (Antigravity) contains the conversation's opening user prompt. If none matches, pass a tight digest of the session instead.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three subagent calls (`Task` with `subagent_type: generalPurpose` and `readonly: false` on Cursor; `invoke_subagent` with `TypeName: "self"` on Antigravity). Reviewers need MCP access to look up the tickets, chat threads, and observability traces the transcript references, and readonly/`research` mode strips MCPs.

Each reviewer and the synthesizer name a role line in the `pstack-models.mdc` / `pstack-models.md` rule and a default. Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset (or `Model: "inherit"`) when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If the subagent tool rejects a slug, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` (or `"pro"` / `"inherit"`) | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` (or `"flash"` / `"inherit"`) | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` (or `"pro"` / `"inherit"`) | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the subagent response body.

## 3. Synthesize

One subagent call (`Task` with `subagent_type: generalPurpose` and `readonly: false` on Cursor; `invoke_subagent` with `TypeName: "self"` on Antigravity), `model` from the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line (default `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` or `"pro"` / `"inherit"`). It spot-verifies citations through MCP, and readonly strips MCPs. Pass `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. It returns an Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to Cursor's built-in `create-skill` skill (or Antigravity's built-in `agy-customizations` skill) and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `create-skill` (or `agy-customizations`) and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via create-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `create-skill` (or `agy-customizations`, writing under `.agents/skills/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md`). Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
